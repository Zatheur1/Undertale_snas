Welcome to the Undertale PowerPoint Engine!
Why did I do this?

i honestly don't even know...

THINGS TO KNOW:
Before you use this engine, PLEASE make sure to download the fonts.
If you don't do this, the entire powerpoint's gonna be fucked up.
The Sans and Papyrus fonts are optional, though.

Pretty much everything you need to make a battle is in here, but I provided a folder for all the entire HUD elements if you want to add stuff like KR.

This engine is pretty easy to understand, I organized all the slides so it should be easy to edit.

ATTACKS:
This is kind of difficult at first but it gets easier when you do it constantly.
For bullets and stuff, use animations or motion paths to move them. You can even get a bit clever and have a whole row of bullets in one image and move that. For moving the heart, use motion paths. Make sure there's no easing and make the duration of the movement "00.50".

That's pretty much it. Enjoy using the engine!

Also for the damage number, make sure it's not in front of the character

i mean you can make it in front of the character
but it looks weird lmao
